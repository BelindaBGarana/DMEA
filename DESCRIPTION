Description: Though there are many algorithms for drug repurposing, most only evaluate individual drugs which can be prone to off-target effects. In contrast, our approach is to evaluate drug mechanisms of action by aggregating results across many drugs. With our tool Drug Mechanism Enrichment Analysis (DMEA), users can query any dataset of interest using either an input gene signature or drug rank list to identify enriched mechanisms of action for drug repurposing efforts.
