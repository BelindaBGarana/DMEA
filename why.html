                <h2>Why use DMEA</h2>
                <p>
                    Even though many methods have been developed to predict beneficial drugs, 
                    most patients remain ineligible for targeted therapies and only about half 
                    of cancer patients deemed eligible respond to treatment. The power of DMEA 
                    lies in aggregating information across many drugs that share a common mechanism of action, 
                    rather than relying on a result from just a single drug. Simply put, if most of the drugs 
                    annotated with a mechanism of action are strong candidates, then we can be more confident 
                    the mechanism may truly be beneficial.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, there are still limitations to DMEA. Perhaps the greatest limitation is 
                    that DMEA relies on the known mechanism of action annotations for each drug. 
                    Nevertheless, DMEA mitigates the risk of false positives by evaluating groups of 
                    drugs which share a mechanism of action rather than relying on a result for a 
                    single drug. Even if a drug is misannotated with a mechanism of action, that 
                    mechanism will not be significantly enriched unless most of the drugs in that 
                    mechanism set are strong candidates based on their rank in the input list. Also, 
                    even if DMEA works as intended to identify drug mechanisms for one phenotype 
                    versus another, not all samples represented by one phenotype may respond similarly 
                    to the same drug and other factors should be considered such as tissue type or tumor 
                    heterogeneity.
